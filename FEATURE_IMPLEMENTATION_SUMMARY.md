### 3. Vehicle Type Filtering for Ride Requests
**Status:** ✅ Fully Implemented

**Problem:** Ride requests were going to ALL online drivers regardless of their vehicle type.

**Solution Implemented:**

#### A. Real-time Ride Notifications (Socket.IO):
**Location:** `requestDelivery` function in deliveryController.js

**Logic:**
1. When customer requests a ride with specific vehicleType (bike/auto/mini_truck/lorry)
2. System finds all approved vehicles matching that type
3. Gets list of drivers who own those vehicles
4. Filters to only online drivers
5. Sends Socket.IO notification ONLY to matching drivers

**Code:**
```javascript
// Find drivers with matching vehicle type who are online
const driversWithMatchingVehicles = await Vehicle.find({
    type: vehicleType,
    approvalStatus: 'approved',
    status: 'available'
}).distinct('driver');

// Get online drivers with matching vehicle type
const onlineDrivers = await User.find({
    _id: { $in: driversWithMatchingVehicles },
    role: 'driver',
    driverStatus: 'online'
}).select('_id');

// Emit to only drivers with matching vehicle type
onlineDrivers.forEach(driver => {
    io.to(`driver: ${driver._id.toString()}`).emit('new_ride_request', newDelivery);
});
```

#### B. Pending Rides List Filtering:
**Location:** `getPendingRides` function in deliveryController.js

**Logic:**
1. When driver requests pending rides list
2. System finds all approved vehicles owned by that driver
3. Extracts unique vehicle types (e.g., ['bike', 'auto'])
4. Returns ONLY pending rides matching driver's vehicle types

**Code:**
```javascript
// Get all approved vehicles owned by this driver
const driverVehicles = await Vehicle.find({
    driver: driverId,
    approvalStatus: 'approved'
}).select('type');

// Extract unique vehicle types
const vehicleTypes = [...new Set(driverVehicles.map(v => v.type))];

// Find pending rides that match driver's vehicle types
const rides = await delivery.find({ 
    status: 'pending',
    vehicleType: { $in: vehicleTypes }
})
```

#### C. Accept Ride Validation:
**Location:** `acceptRide` function in deliveryController.js

**Added validation to prevent drivers from accepting rides with wrong vehicle type:**

```javascript
// Validate vehicle type matches ride requirement
if (vehicle.type !== ride.vehicleType) {
    return res.status(400).json({
        message: `This ride requires a ${ride.vehicleType} but you selected a ${vehicle.type}`
    });
}
```

**Files Modified:**
- `backend/controllers/deliveryController.js` - Updated requestDelivery, getPendingRides, and acceptRide functions

**How It Works:**

**Example Scenario:**
1. Customer books a ride and selects "auto" as vehicle type
2. System finds all drivers with approved "auto" vehicles who are online
3. Only those drivers receive the ride notification
4. When drivers check pending rides, they only see rides matching their vehicle types
5. If a driver tries to accept a ride with wrong vehicle type, system rejects it

**Benefits:**
- ✅ Drivers only see relevant ride requests
- ✅ Reduces notification spam
- ✅ Improves matching efficiency
- ✅ Prevents mismatched vehicle assignments
- ✅ Better user experience for both drivers and customers

## API Endpoints Summary

### New Endpoints:
1. `PUT /api/deliveries/:id/complete` - Driver completes ride
2. `PUT /api/deliveries/:id/cancel` - Customer cancels ride

### Modified Endpoints:
1. `POST /api/deliveries/request` - Now filters by vehicle type
2. `GET /api/deliveries/pending` - Now returns only matching vehicle types
3. `POST /api/deliveries/:id/accept` - Now validates vehicle type match

---

## Socket.IO Events

### New Events:
1. `rideCompleted` - Emitted to customer when driver completes ride
2. `rideCancelled` - Emitted to driver when customer cancels ride

### Existing Events (Enhanced):
1. `new_ride_request` - Now sent only to drivers with matching vehicle type

---

## Database Schema

No schema changes required. All features use existing fields:
- `delivery.vehicleType` - Already exists
- `delivery.status` - Already supports 'delivered' and 'cancelled'
- `vehicle.type` - Already exists
- `vehicle.approvalStatus` - Already exists
- `user.driverStatus` - Already exists

---

## Next Steps

1. **Test all features thoroughly** using the testing checklist above
2. **Monitor console logs** to verify vehicle type filtering is working
3. **Test Socket.IO notifications** by having multiple users online
4. **Verify authorization** - ensure drivers can't complete other drivers' rides
5. **Check edge cases:**
   - Driver with multiple vehicle types
   - Driver with no approved vehicles
   - Customer cancelling already completed ride
   - Driver completing already cancelled ride

---

## Notes

- All changes maintain backward compatibility
- Comprehensive error handling implemented
- Real-time notifications via Socket.IO
- Authorization checks prevent unauthorized actions
- Logging added for debugging and monitoring
- Toast notifications provide user feedback
- Loading states improve UX during async operations
