# ðŸ§ª Quick Test - History Fix

## What was fixed:
1. **Removed duplicate `fetchRides` function** - This was causing "Cannot redeclare block-scoped variable" error
2. **Fixed function hoisting issue** - Moved `fetchRides` definition before its usage in `useEffect`
3. **Proper error handling** - Component should now load without React errors

## Test Steps:

1. **Refresh your browser** (Ctrl+F5 or Cmd+Shift+R)
2. **Check for React errors** - The red error screen should be gone
3. **Navigate to History tab** - Should load properly now
4. **Check console** - Should see loading state changes and successful data fetch

## Expected Console Output:
```
ðŸ”„ Loading state changed to: true
ðŸ”„ Fetching rides for history...
âœ… Rides fetched successfully: 23 rides
ðŸ”„ Setting loading to false...
ðŸ”„ Loading state changed to: false
```

## If still having issues:
- Check browser console for any remaining errors
- Try the "Force Refresh" button in the debug component
- Clear browser cache and reload

The React errors should be completely resolved now!
