## üîç Debugging Tips

### Check Backend Console:
Look for these log messages:
```
üì¢ Sent [vehicleType] delivery request to X matching drivers
üìã Driver [ID] has vehicle types: [types], found X matching rides
```

### Check Frontend Console:
- Socket.IO connection status
- API request/response logs
- Error messages

### Check MongoDB:
```javascript
// Check vehicle types
db.vehicles.find({ approvalStatus: "approved" }, { driver: 1, type: 1 })

// Check driver status
db.users.find({ role: "driver" }, { name: 1, driverStatus: 1 })

// Check pending rides
db.deliveries.find({ status: "pending" }, { vehicleType: 1, customer: 1 })
```

### Common Issues:

**Issue 1: Driver not receiving notifications**
- Check: Is driver online? (`driverStatus: "online"`)
- Check: Does driver have approved vehicle of matching type?
- Check: Is Socket.IO connected? (check browser console)

**Issue 2: Pending rides list empty**
- Check: Does driver have any approved vehicles?
- Check: Are there any pending rides in database?
- Check: Do pending rides match driver's vehicle types?

**Issue 3: Cannot accept ride**
- Check: Is ride still pending?
- Check: Does selected vehicle match ride's vehicleType?
- Check: Is vehicle approved?
